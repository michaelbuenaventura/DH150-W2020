# Usability Testing

### The purpose of usability testing is to diagnose problem areas that were left undiagnosed from heuristic evaluation.
To review, our heuristic evaluation showed that QuickTapSurvey was sound in the way it presented information. It was
intuitive and fairly easy to use. However, we found that the app version limited the ability to create surveys. Additionally,
more features could be added to make the app more flexible and adaptable to frequent users. In response to the heuristic evaluation,
I am following up with a usability test of both the desktop website and app versions of QuickTapSurvey. The application is meant
to use the two in tandem. This way, I am able to test the creation, distribution, and analyes of surveys.

### Our test revealed some minor issues with the app. Our participant was na√Øve to the app, but was familiar with research and
data as a stats major. The test overall confirmed some of our positive findings from the heuristic evaluation. The order of information
was presented well. The icons and language were familiar to the participant. On the other hand, the participant missed the "publish"
phase of the survey and wound up continuing a process that should not have been continued. The survey was saved automatically
as a draft, with no warning that it was unpublished. The user proceeded to attempt to administer an unpublished survey. It
took a few minutes to realize this. In this case, the user may have had too much freedom. In terms of customizability, it
seemed impractical to test for this since the user had no prior experience with the app. Regardless, the usability test was successful
in revealing new usability issues.
