# Personas and Scenarios

The purpose of this page is to provide possible personas that would be concerned with a better human-subjects research app and scenarios for them to use it.

## Personas

### Persona: College-Aged Aspiring Researcher

![ChristineImage](/assignment6/ChristineSantos.JPG)

#### Name: Christine Santos
#### Title(s): Undergraduate Sociology Major, Research Assistant, Florida State University
#### Demographics
* 19 years old
* Single
* Filipino-American
* 1st-Generation College Student

#### Goals and Tasks
Christine is highly motivated to learn as much as she can about research while in college. 
As an undergraduate, she asks a lot of questions and explores using different tools to 
accomplish various tasks assigned to her classes and research lab. These tasks include:

* Creating and formatting digital surveys
* Coding survey data
* Sending survey notifications and reminders to participants

#### Environment
##### Goal Barriers
* She only has access to free or cheap research applicaitons.
* She is only allowed to work on low-level tasks such as inputting survey answers and sending reminder emails.
##### Goal Facilitators
* She talks in-depth with associate researchers about the best methods and tools.
* She is quite tech-savvy, as she grew up a frequent cell-phone and computer user.
#### Quote
"Which participants do you want me to send an email reminder to?"

### Persona: Silicon Valley Industry Researcher

![DavidImage](/assignment6/DavidFontino.JPEG)

#### Name: David Fontino
#### Title(s): Market Researcher, Alphabet Inc.
#### Demographics
* 27 years old
* Single
* American-born Italian
* College Graduate

#### Goals and Tasks
Though David earns a high-income from a startup company, he lives a fast-paced life working 60-80 hours per week.
He is obsessed with meeting deadlines. He is in charge of multiple market-research projects, and has the following
responsibilities:

* Gather user insights, both qualitative and quantitative
* Conduct surveys/focus group interviews both online and in-person
* Analyzing collected data
* Creating reports of research projects to present to higher-ups

#### Environment
##### Goal Barriers
* He is assigned more projects than he can handle, but agrees to do them anyway. Time and efficiency are very precious to him.
* He does not want to get his master's degree, so he is not quite stats-savvy and "wings it" everytime he presents.
##### Goal Facilitators
* He is young and full of both energy and caffeine. His office is open around the clock and he is encouraged to stay overtime.
* His company pays for whatever software he needs, as long as he fills out a request for it.
#### Quote
"Please get me the data pull by end-of-business-day today so I can start my analyses tonight.

### Persona: Tenured Psychology Professor

![JackImage](/assignment6/JackGaston.JPG)

#### Name: Jack Gaston, PhD
#### Title(s): Psychology Department Head, Duke University
#### Demographics
* 58 years old
* Married
* White American
* PhD in Social Psychology

#### Goals and Tasks
Dr. Gaston is a well-established researcher at Duke University. He has published dozens of papers and has been cited hundreds
of times. Today, he is the Principal Investigator of his own lab that deals with mob-mentality. He is in charge of the most
high-level tasks, such as:

* Making decisions on research methodology
* Having the final say about insights on collected data
* Overseeing all research activity of research assistants, grad students, etc.

#### Environment
##### Goal Barriers
* He is very traditional with his methods. He is not super tech-savvy and sometimes likes disrtibuting paper surveys.
* He is conservative when it comes to trying new methods and prefers "tried and true" processes.
* He is a very hands-off worker and works more as a task manager than a researcher.
##### Goal Facilitators
* He is well-funded by both grants and Duke University, so he has access to various applications and resources
* He is well respected among his colleagues, and what he says goes in his lab.
#### Quote
"Can you code that stack of surveys into Excel for me?"

## Scenarios

### 1. Similar Survey in One Fell Swoop
#### Our persona is Christine Santos. Her goal is to learn high-level research, but is constantly bogged down by low-level tasks she is assigned. She wants to get these smaller tasks over with so that she can explore harder tasks.
1. Christine wants to work on her personal project, but is assigned to create a new survey for the lab. She cannot work on her personal project until this task is done. 
2. The new survey is for a control arm. It is to be entirely based off of an already-existing survey for the experimental arm. Everything in the new survey should be identical to the existing survey, except that every occurance of the word "democrat" should be replaced with "conservative".
3. Instead of copying and pasting each question into a new survey, Christine uses DataNet's find and replace feature. First, she duplicates the experimental survey. She then proceeds to highlight every occurance of "democrat" and replace them with "conservative" in just a couple of clicks. She finishes this task and continues working on her personal project.

### 2. Suggested Analyses
#### Our persona is David Fontino. Her goal is to pump out as many market research projects as possible to move up the ranks of his industry job. He is in charge of data anaylses and creating presentations for higher-ups.
1. David wants to analyze his latest dataset which deals with ethnicity and product preferences. Doing so will help him complete the analysis phase of this project.
2. Since David didn't go to grad school, he typically struggles to decide on analysis types. He usually tries to Google which type of analysis to use or consults other team members. This takes a considerable amount of time.
3. Luckily, DataNet has a built-in analysis suggester. The program recognized that there may be a significant effect produced if product preferences are measured across ethnicities. It recognizes the variable types and suggests running an ANOVA. David listens and is able to find significant differences between White and non-White product preferences.

### 3. In-App Visualization
#### Our persona is David Fontino. Her goal is to pump out as many market research projects as possible to move up the ranks of his industry job. He is in charge of data anaylses and creating presentations for higher-ups.
1. David wants to present his most recent findings to his boss. He is hopeful that this project will make his boss see his potential and possibly give him a raise. His presentation is later today and he has the slide deck ready except for figures.
2. In the past, David would export his data to a visualization software, such as Tableau. This would take extra time and effort, as the data had to be formatted correctly and large datasets take a while to transfer.
3. David instead uses DataNet's in-app visualization feature. With no need to export/clean data, David can create graphs within the app in just a few clicks. He creates these graphs, downloads them as interactive images, and uploads them to his slide deck. He now has time to practice his presentation.
