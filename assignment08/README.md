# Interactive Prototype - DataNet

## Description

The purpose of this project is to provide a versatile mobile tool for human-subjects researchers. At this stage, low-fidelity 
wireflows were developed into a high-fidelity interactive prototype. This prototype was created on Figma. This stage involved 
familiarizing myself with Figma, determining color schemes and objects, creating screens, and testing the prototype. The purposes of 
the interactive prototype are to better visualize information flow and interactivity and to test the interactivity of the app structure. 
This prototype tests three specific features: Find & Replace, Data Analyzer, and Data Visualizer.
### Tasks:
1. Find and Replace
Create a new arm of the Car Survey. For every instance of "car" replace it with "motorcycle".
2. Data Analyzer
Conduct a one-way ANOVA on the Car Survey. Find and interpret the p-value.
3. Data Visualizer
Create a pie chart of the Car Survey to depict the distribution of car models. Send the chart to your email.

## Graphic Design

### Color Scheme

Both accessibility and subject-relevance were kept in mind when determining the color scheme. To ensure accessible accommodation, both the
Chrome accessibility audit and snook.ca were used to determine whether or not color contrasts were appropriate. To find research-relevant colors,
I found inspiration by searching "research" on Adobe Color.

### Minimilistic Design

Instead of flooding screens with text or images, I opted to use simple icons. This is less visually taxing for the user and allows the user to focus
more on the task at hand.

### System Status and User Freedom

During my lo-fi prototype testing, I ran into 2 major issues: users didn't know when they completed tasks and users couldn't back out of unwanted actions. 
In the hi-fidelity prototype, I made sure to include system status notifications and plenty back/cancel buttons.
