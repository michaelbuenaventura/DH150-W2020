# Data Net

## Michael Buenaventura, Digital Humanities 150 - Winter 2020, Professor Cho

### I want to contribute to the human-subjects research community with my UX design. Much of research on humans requires data collection via surveys and forms. Creating, distributing, and analyzing these instruments take up a significant amount of time in the research process. Making this process more efficient through app-based distrubition can save both researchers and participants valuable time and energy.
