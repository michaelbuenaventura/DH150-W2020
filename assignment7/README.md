# Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description
DataNet is the researcher's best friend. Many research tasks are mundane and inefficient. Editing surveys, running through analyses,
and creating visualizations all require some sort of repetition. DataNet is meant to cut out wasted time on repetetive actions and 
make the lives of researchers more efficient. In the end, researchers can focus on higher-level tasks such as methodology decisions 
and research conclusions.

Our product is meant to serve researchers at all levels. We identified three representative personas: undergraduate research assistants, 
full-time applied researchers, and established PhD Principal Investigators. We intervied an undergraduate research assistant as a form of 
contextual inquiry and created scenarios to storytell our clientele's journeys.

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to further the scenarios we created earlier. This is meant to hash out details about layout 
of information presented on each screen. This is not meant to analyze aesthetics or graphics. This is meant to understand how clients want 
their information structured and presented to them. By the end of this, we hope to have a better sense of an intuitive information structure. More 
specifically, we are analyzing consumers' interactions with the following features.

### Features
1. A "Find and Replace" feature to quickly create surveys for "arms" of experiments.
2. An "Anaylsis Suggester" that suggests analyses to be run that will produce significant results.
3. A "Visualizer" that allows for comprehensive, in-app visualizations to be made.

## Find and Replace

User was able to complete the task, but is unsure if they have reached the end-state. The user also wants to rename the survey.

User is confused with my home page and wants to begin with "My Surveys" rather than "Anaylze" to analyze an existing survey.

User was able to complete the task, but is confused about the end-state.

### Wireflow Testing

User is confused with my home page and wants to begin with "My Surveys" rather than "Visualize" to begin visualizing an existing survey.
The user was able to complete this task fairly quickly after getting through the home page confusion.

## Summary

Creating a low-fidelity prototype was enlightening and humbling. Previously, it seemed easy to make an intuitive flow of information. Now, 
I understand that it takes a good amount of work to make something feel intuitive. From a creator's standpoint, making something intuitive 
is not so intuitive. Users are spoiled because using something intuitive is intuitive. I expected the creation process to be less meticulous. 
Instead of simply going with my gut on information flow, this phase required a lot of empathy practice.

I ran into two major problems during my testing. The first problem is that my home page does not seem to be easy to use. I have multiple buttons 
that access existing surveys (My Surveys, Analyze, Visualize), but with different options once the user chooses one. I can see how this can be 
confusing and can send the user back to the homepage. Creating an information hierarchy beforehand (much like a computer directory) could be useful 
for creating a better homepage. I would have one button that accesses existing surveys (My Surveys) and multiple options within My Surveys.
The second problem is that users are unsure of the end-state, when they have accomplished their goal. I do not necessarily think that this is an 
information flow issue. I think that once I am focused on aesthetics, I can make sure it is clear on the page that the user has done what they are 
trying to do (by adding text notifications that "pop out").
