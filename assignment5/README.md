# Contextual Inquiry

## Design Challenge

My project would generally support research activity done by human-subjects researchers. More specifically,
my project aims to streamline the data-collection process by making creating, distributing, answering, and 
analyzing surveys seamless. The basic need involved is the need to gain insights from humans. The traditional
solution to this is manually creating a paper survey and distributing it by hand. This is rather time inefficient
Newer methods involve using applications like Google Forms and Survey Monkey. Multiple apps are typically used to
go through the entire data-collection process (Adobe to create an aesthetic survey, MailChimp to email it, voyant
to analyze qualitative responses, etc.). This can be improved by providing an all-in-one application.

## Target Users

The target users are people within the research community - both academic and applied. This boils down to three categories.

### Novice Research Assistants/Interns
These are people just coming onto the research scene. They are typically in college and are doing research as part of
a class or extra-curricular experience. These users are typically tech-savvy, but are novices with research methods. These
users would be doing the nitty-gritty research work: formatting surveys, sending surveys out, and reminding people to create
surveys.

### Budding Career Researchers
These include grad-students and full-time applied researchers. They are typically in their late 20's or 30's and work in 
university labs or company research teams. They are tech-familiar, though might show preferences to devices/apps they are 
familiar with. They are knowledgeable about research methods and can get insights from data. Budding Career Researchers would 
typically be creating survey instruments or analyzing collected data.

### Established Researchers
These include PhD's and PI's. They are likely between 30 and 70 years old. They are experts in research and can spot nuances in collected
data. They may or may not be tech-savvy given that they are older. Like the previous group, they typically work in universities or private
research teams. These users make decisions about which questions to ask and have the final say on insights gathered.

## Research Methods and Plan
### Process and environment
I am conducting an interview at the home of someone who conducted market research. I chose to interview them at their home because they
worked there remotely. I discussed a few main questions with them about the research process in general and related tasks. Additionally,
I observed them complete a couple of research tasks.
### Tasks
I had the subject 
1. create a survey and 
2. send it via email. 

These are two common tasks in the research world. While this task may seem simple
and easy, researchers must do these quite often. Having a seamless way to create a survey and mass-send it is crucial for efficient research.

### Reflection
There are takeways concerning both my interview style and the project itself.

In terms of interviewing, I felt that my questions were too broad and that I led the users too often. My interviewee had to think long and hard about most of my questions. I felt that there was too much silence due to the nature of my questions. Narrowing down the focus of my questions could add clarity, especially for the interviewee. To cope with this silence, I felt that I led too much. For example, I would ask "How has this app worked for you?" and follow with "Have you had any compatibility issues with other apps". This adds some bias. I should pare down on this as well if I want to get non-biased responses.

In terms of analyzing the actual data, I found two prominent themes: desire to get away from repetition and desire to move towards an all-in-one app. When it comes to creating surveys, repetition is almost inevitable - researchers need the same insights on different products or different arms of a study. The current solution involves a lot of copy-pasting and could be made much more efficient. A sort of "find and replace" function could be useful when designing surveys. Additionally, researchers look for an all-in-one app. Google Forms and Survey Monkey are leaders in data collection because they allow for creation, distribution, AND analyis. However, the anaylsis phase is typically taken a step further to other software (Voyant, R, etc.). Having advanced insights within a data-collection app could be very attractive to researchers.
